# Matlab CodeBlock Python Integration

## Overview

There has been a task that I had to deal with, in the early stages after joining HERMES Team. 
That includes a simple schema that uses Python and Matlab to create a type of subsystem that utilizes team's proexisting Python Code (Software) in the Matlab and Simulink Environment.

                                              ** Runned and Tested in Matlab Simulink **
