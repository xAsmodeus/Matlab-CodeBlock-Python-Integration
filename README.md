## Overview

There has been a task that I 

## Approach / Methodology

There was a testing of parameters in the model(lr, different optimizers , dropout rates , pre-trained models and data-augmentation). The model was trained in 20 epochs, with a MobileNetV2/ResNet150V2 with early stopping for overfitting prevention. The results and the plots are being shown in the .ipynb file as well as the commentary.
